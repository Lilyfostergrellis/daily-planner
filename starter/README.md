# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is a Daily planner which is written and developed using Javascript JQuery. The page displays a full working day timetable (from 9AM to 5PM) where the user is able to save events by clicking on the save button (represented by a floppy disk icon). Each saved event will be saved to the local storage, if the page is refreshed the events will still be displayed. 

## Desired Outcome

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
